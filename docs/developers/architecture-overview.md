# How JobPilot AI is structured

**Content type:** Conceptual

JobPilot AI has one Streamlit interface, one application database boundary, one
collection configuration, and one discovery pipeline. This page explains where
each contract belongs.

## Application flow

Labeled `st.page_link` controls expose **Jobs**, **Searches**, and **Insights**
over hidden native Streamlit routing. This avoids the framework's inaccessible
responsive drawer while preserving direct URLs. Every page calls services that
share the engine and session helpers in `jobpilot/database/engine.py`.

## Interface ownership

The interface keeps one implementation per task:

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `jobpilot/ui/main.py` | Page configuration and hidden native routing |
| `jobpilot/ui/design.py` | Visual tokens, responsive CSS, reduced motion, and presentation helpers |
| `jobpilot/ui/pages/jobs.py` | Workflow filters, review mutations, and application tracking |
| `jobpilot/ui/pages/searches.py` | Saved-search forms and manual runs |
| `jobpilot/ui/pages/insights.py` | Read-only workflow, salary, trend, and company summaries |

The application does not use a second component framework, custom browser
detection, URL-state adapters, page-level service caches, or a parallel sidebar
shell.

## Service ownership

Each mutable concept has one owner:

| Component | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jobpilot/database/engine.py` | Engine creation, session scope, commit, and rollback | Business queries |
| `SavedSearchService` | Search definitions and latest run health | Persisted jobs |
| `JobSpySource` | Provider parameters and row conversion | Database transactions |
| `JobService` | Job queries and scrape persistence | UI state |
| `ApplicationService` | Workflow stage, star, notes, and archive state | Provider fields |
| `AnalyticsService` | Personal-scale job aggregates | A second analytics database |
| `MatchingService` | Explainable match scoring and cached results | UI state |
| `CostMonitor` | Typed operational cost events and monthly budget health | Connections or UI alerts |

## Job workflow contract

Every job has one typed `ApplicationStage` value:

1. `Inbox`
2. `Saved`
3. `Applied`
4. `Screening`
5. `Interview`
6. `Offer`
7. `Rejected`

The database enforces the same values with a check constraint. Stars and notes
remain independent fields owned by the `Application` record.

Alembic revision `8f4b2c91a3d7` migrated the former stage values before adding
the constraint (`New` → `Inbox`, `Interested` → `Saved`, `Rejected` → `Closed`).
The current stage set is defined by `ApplicationStage` in
`jobpilot/models/enums.py`.

The same revision normalizes legacy null salary values and safely adopts any
former service-owned cost table. Invalid legacy timestamps, ownership, or costs
stop before schema DDL; legacy metadata remains readable as JSON objects.
Migration provenance ensures downgrade preserves a cost table that existed
before the revision.

Follow-up revision `c91e7a4d2b6f` repairs databases already stamped by the draft
migration. It imports the retired sibling `costs.db` once without changing that
file, remaps colliding identifiers instead of overwriting canonical rows, and
records the source-to-target identifier mapping for safe retries. It normalizes
already-adopted cost metadata to JSON objects and losslessly converts
two-element finite, integral numeric salary pairs to integer-or-null JSON. Any
unsafe salary shape aborts the revision before mutation with the affected row
and raw value so it can be repaired and retried. The revision then enforces the
required salary column. SQLite migrations use native non-legacy transaction
control so an interrupted schema change rolls back before retry.

The follow-up downgrade is deliberately forward-only and does not delete imported
history, provenance, or repaired salary data. Re-upgrading is idempotent.

## Saved-search lifecycle

A saved search is the only collection configuration. It stores the query,
location, sites, remote flag, job type, result limit, and enabled state.

The runner records one finite status:

1. Record `running` before provider work starts
2. Replace the lease timestamp with the completion time and record `succeeded`
   with jobs seen and inserted after a successful response
3. Record `partial` when only some provider rows validate
4. Record `failed` with an error after a provider or persistence failure
5. Record `cancelled` if task cancellation interrupts the run

The contract also supports `never`. Deleting or disabling a saved search never
deletes persisted jobs.

## Persistence rules

Job upserts and the saved search's terminal run health share one transaction. A
failure between those writes rolls back every job and company mutation from that
result, so a run cannot leave durable jobs behind while still reporting
`running`.

The service enforces these rules:

- A job needs a title, company, and direct or listing URL
- The direct application URL wins when both URLs exist
- The URL identifies an existing job
- A repeated row updates provider-owned fields and preserves stage, star, notes,
  and archive state
- A company exists only when a valid job references it
- Company totals and latest-posted dates are aggregate query results

## Search and analytics

Search and analytics query the same committed state as the rest of the
application. Neither service creates an engine or stores a duplicate cache.

Search applies AND semantics across whitespace-separated terms across title,
description, company, and location via `JobFilters` and
`job_service.list_jobs`. It returns detached contracts, so UI code never depends
on a live session.

Analytics computes job trends, company counts, and salary summaries with
SQLAlchemy. Add another engine only after measured workload evidence justifies
its lifecycle and consistency cost.
